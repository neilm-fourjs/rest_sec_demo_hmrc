# An example using the HMRC's API

https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api

This repo contains a demo suite and some test programs.

The hmrcDemo is two programs:
hmrcDemo - main program to get and show organisations from the rest calls and get obligations.
hmrcGrant - handles getting the accessToken and storing it in the DB via delegation.

*NOTE* You'll have to edit the two .xcf files and fill in the resources with your client-id / secret-id & server token.


*NOTE* The test account you create for the Web page does NOT allow allow most of the calls. You MUST create a test account using the API!
